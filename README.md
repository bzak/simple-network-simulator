To create such animation you will need 
- Gephi http://www.gephi.org
- Gephi graph streaming plugin https://gephi.org/plugins/graph-streaming/

Just turn on the streaming plugin in Gephi and run simulator. Binaries are ready to run in /deploy folder.

The program also calculates correlation within ego networks as described in the paper:

I know the code is quite ugly, I'm sorry for that but it is a fork of another project and it was intended for research purposes only. 
It depends on tinkerpop gremlin version 0.6 

However - it should work :)
